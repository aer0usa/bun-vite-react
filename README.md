# Bun, Vite, & React

This is me playing around with Bun, Vite, and React

This was super easy to set up with `bun create vite bun-vite-react`

See [Build a frontend using Vite and Bun](https://bun.sh/guides/ecosystem/vite)

This is easy to get started, and fast!

You can run this by:
* [Installing Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
* `bun install`
* `bun run dev`

OR, you can run this without installing Bun, with Podman by 
* running the included `podman-bun.sh`

## Original Readme:

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
